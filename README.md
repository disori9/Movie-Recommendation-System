# Movie-Recommendation-System
A movie recommendation system that includes collaborative, content, and popularity based filtering based on the dataset given.

This was done in a jupyter-lab in deepnote.

I wanted to learn a bit about machine learning and implemented it in the collaborative-based filtering notebook section.  

In content-based filtering, I used scikit, however it may be a bit inaccurate as it only compares one column instead of multiple.

In popularity-based filtering, I only used movies that are in the 90th percentile of the database. Then I used a formula to determine a fair average rating based on the number of votes and the average rating.
